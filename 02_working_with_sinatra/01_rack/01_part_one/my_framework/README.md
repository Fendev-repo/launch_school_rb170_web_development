# Growing Your Own Web Framework With Rack Part 1

This post is the first part in a four part series on how to build your own web framework with Rack. The 4-part series will cover what rack is, how to use it to handle incoming requests, how to use templating techniques to return a response, and finally, how to extract common code to plant the seeds for your very own web application development framework. Here in part 1, we’ll give a short introduction on what Rack is and how to use it. We’ll end things by building a simple Rack application.
